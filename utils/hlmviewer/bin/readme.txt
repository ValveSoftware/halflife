1. Notes
--------

  Written by Mete Ciragan, the model code was developed using the model code
  from Valve's mdlviewer.

2. Shortcuts for the fullscreen mode
------------------------------------

  - Space:  cycle sequence
  - Esc:    quit fullscreen mode
  - 'g':    toggle ground
  - 'm':    toggle mirror
  - 'b':    toggle background
  - 's':    toggle stencil buffer (used for correct mirror)
  - 'h':    show hitboxes
  - '1':    wireframe (3dfx: smoothshaded)
  - '2':    flatshaded (3dfx: smoothshaded)
  - '3':    smoothshaded
  - '4':    textured
  - '5':    more transparent
  - '6':    less transparent
  - '-':    decrease animation speed
  - '+':    increase animation speed



3. 3Dfx support
---------------

  - If you downloaded the version without the 3dfxgl.dll or want to update
    it, just copy it into the directory of hlmv.exe.

  - You can start the hlmv_sm.exe (Half-Life Model Viewer Safe Mode), if
    the model viewer starts directly with the 3Dfx hardware. It just renames
    opengl32.dll to 3dfxgl.dll and launches the model viewer.
