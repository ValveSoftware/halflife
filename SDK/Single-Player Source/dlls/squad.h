// these are special group roles that are assigned to members when the group is formed.
// the reason these are explicitly assigned and tasks like throwing grenades to flush out 
// enemies is that it's bad to have two members trying to flank left at the same time, but 
// ok to have two throwing grenades at the same time. When a squad member cannot attack the 
// enemy, it will choose to execute its special role.
