Half-Life 1
======================

This is the GitHub Repository for the Half-Life 1 engine and its associated games.

Here, you can find the SDK code of the client & server DLLs for Half-Life, Deathmatch Classic and Ricochet. The three DLLs are at their latest versions as published on Steam with the Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update. If you wish to use the older SDK from 2013, it can be found in the `steam_legacy` branch.

Additionally you can use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Half-Life 1 related products.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter an issue while using Half-Life 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue;
- your system information.\*; and
- the `version` output from the in-game console.

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.

Conduct
-------


There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Half-Life.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.


Building the SDK code
-------

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 is required to build mod DLLs on Windows. In the Visual Studio installer, install "**Desktop development with C++**" under "**Workloads**" and "**C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 & x64)**" under "**Individual components**". VS2019 projects can be found in the `projects\vs2019` folder.

Tools have not yet been updated for VS2019, but can be built using the VS2010 projects in the `projects\vs2010` folder. See the `readme.txt` file there.

Linux binaries can be built using Makefiles found in the `linux` folder. They expect to be built / run in the [Steam Runtime "scout" environment](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk). The built binaries are copied to a directory called `game` at the same level as the root directory for the git repository. You can set `CREATE_OUTPUT_DIRS=1` while building to create the output directory structure automatically.
